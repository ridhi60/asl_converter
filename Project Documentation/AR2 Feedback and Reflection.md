# Architecture Review Reflection

## Feedback and Decisions
_Based upon your notes from the technical review, synthesize the feedback you received addressing your key questions. How do you plan to incorporate it going forward? What new questions did you generate?_

Based on the feedback we received during the review, it seems as though the audience thinks we have made enough progress to continue with our current plan and still finish on time, so we have scoped it fairly well so far. We considered modifying the program so that it takes a screenshot of the user's hand instead of continuously tracking what it sees, so we asked for some feedback on how users would feel using each option. There were mixed reviews, although the majority recommended staying away from the method of taking a screenshot because it seems more cumbersome for the user and adds unnecessary complexity to the experience. However, on the other side there are concerns about how fast the program can run if it is trying to recognize symbols in real time, as it would be frustrating to have to wait for the algorithm to "catch up" to where you are in terms of hand movements. Overall we got positive feedback on how the website looks, we just need to polish the looks a bit and fill it with the information that needs to be there.

As we continue to work and near the end of the project, we first of all want to make sure we get to a point where we can recognize gestures in the first place. More work is needed here, because without that the rest of the feedback we received is a moot point anyways. We will continue focusing our efforts on this before we can spend a ton of time on the looks and usability of the program. However, once we get there we will definitely use the information we got from the audience to make sure we have something that users are happy with.


## Review Process Reflection
_How did the review go? Did you get answers to your key questions? Did you provide too much/too little context for your audience? Did you stick closely to your planned agenda, or did you discover new things during the discussion that made you change your plans? What could you do next time to have an even more effective technical review?_

The review was very helpful in terms of getting our questions answered. The audience had insightful responses for everything we wanted feedback on, and it should help us move towards our goals effectively. We were faster than expected going over the context and the rest of our slides, so we had more time for questions; this ended up actually being more useful, because we got to hear more opinions from more people with the extra time we had left over. We were even able to give a small demo of how the code works, which allowed for more input on the actual functionality instead of only surface-level questions about aesthetics and how to display our project when it is finished. For a future review, we might want to have more questions that provoke a more coding-heavy discussion of processes, because we feel that there is untapped potential in asking our fellow peers with different perspectives how they might approach a specific problem we are facing.
